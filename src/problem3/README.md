Analysis of Issues

1. getPriority() is not memoized
- Issue: The getPriority() function is defined inside the component, so it gets re-created on every render, which is inefficient.
- Solution: Move it outside the component or memoize it using useCallback().

2. Undeclared variable lhsPriority
- Issue: lhsPriority is not declared â€“ this is a critical logic error.
- Solution: It should be balancePriority instead of lhsPriority.

3. Incorrect useMemo dependency
- Issue: useMemo lists [balances, prices] as dependencies, but prices is not used inside the memo block.
- Solution: Remove prices from the dependency list or use it properly if needed.

4. Missing safety check on prices[balance.currency]
- Issue: prices[balance.currency] might be undefined, which will cause a runtime error.
- Solution: Add a fallback or a safety check before multiplying.

5. Using index as React key
- Issue: Using index as a key is a known anti-pattern in React. It can lead to incorrect component re-renders.
- Solution: Use a stable unique key like balance.currency.

6. formattedBalances is declared but never used
- Issue: Unused variable leads to clutter and confusion.

7. Type WalletBalance is missing blockchain field
- Issue: The blockchain field is being used but not defined in the type interface.
